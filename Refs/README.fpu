  ... relaxation times of quite different orders of magnitude may show up.
  This actually constitutes what we now call the metastability scenario: The time-averages of the relevant physical quantities are expected to agree with the predictions of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics at any energy after a sufficiently long time-scale, the “final” one (which is the one described by the limit t → ∞), and the paradox is interpreted as corresponding to the existence of another, shorter, time-scale (the fast scale), within which a relaxation is produced to some intermediate state. Such an intermediate state at first sight appears as an equilibrium one, although it is destined to subsequently relax, on a much longer timescale, to the “final” quilibrium state. The way in which the existence of an energy threshold can be conceived within such a metastability scenario was understood much later (see [14]).
